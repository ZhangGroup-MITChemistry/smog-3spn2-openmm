# test-0.3mM-system

As we cannot save system as xml file for 0.3 mM nucleosome concentration, we test if we can run simulations by building the system from scratch and run, without saving system xml file. 

We also aim to test if we can smoothly load x3dna template previously built, thus later the system can be easily built without requiring x3dna.
